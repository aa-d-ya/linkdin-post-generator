        "text": "Last year, while working abroad, my focus was on professional growth and new experiences.\nDuring the initial career phase, everyone does overlook the importance of financial and risk management but it only takes one mishap to regret your negligence.\nWith me being the only earning member of my family, I realized how crucial it was to get a term life insurance policy.\nIt\u2019s a myth that only elders or those with families need insurance; it\u2019s vital for anyone who wants to protect their loved ones.\nYou need to ensure that your loved ones would be financially secure if anything happens.\nHere are a few key takeaways from my research that might help others:\n1. Getting term insurance early is cheaper. If you start around 25, premiums for a \u20b91 crore cover are much lower than if you wait.\n2. Even without kids or a spouse, your parents or siblings might rely on you financially, making it essential to have coverage.\n3. Term insurance offers tax savings under section 80C, which is always a nice bonus.\nI would suggest you check Ditto Insurance as they\u2019ll be of great help if you're at your initial phase to start your insurance journey.\nTheir services are honest and they will help you learn more.\nThey provide their consultation services free of cost so it can benefit you all with zero spam calls and great financial insights.\nIf you're interested you can book a call with them: https://ditto.sh/b9cwsi",

With Valentine's Week in full swing, multiple brands are launching creative marketing campaigns, as it is known to be the peak season for gifting. One campaign that stood out to me was a unique print ad in The Times of India by Fabelle Chocolates that I saw yesterday. At first glance, the ad appeared quite minimalistic, but it featured a QR code that, when scanned, unlocked a great VR experience. This campaign was innovative and also perfectly aligned with their brand messaging. The ad had royalty, luxury, and premium appeal in every aspect. Shoutout to the copywriter who thought of the sweet and witty one-liners for each element. Chocolates and Valentine\u2019s Day are inseparable, and introducing such an interactive concept while highlighting flavours inspired by nature is a smart move: earth, water, fire, air and space. While reading the article states having a sensorial taste with each bite and honestly, with ingredients like Acacia Nectar, French Sea Salt, Candied Mango, and Ancho Chilli I don't doubt them. Promoting premium products is always a challenge, but leveraging advanced VR marketing would help this campaign gain more traction. I know for sure my team and I would love to get our hands on this!",
