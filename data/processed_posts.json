With Valentine's Week in full swing, multiple brands are launching creative marketing campaigns, as it is known to be the peak season for gifting. One campaign that stood out to me was a unique print ad in The Times of India by Fabelle Chocolates that I saw yesterday. At first glance, the ad appeared quite minimalistic, but it featured a QR code that, when scanned, unlocked a great VR experience. This campaign was innovative and also perfectly aligned with their brand messaging. The ad had royalty, luxury, and premium appeal in every aspect. Shoutout to the copywriter who thought of the sweet and witty one-liners for each element. Chocolates and Valentine\u2019s Day are inseparable, and introducing such an interactive concept while highlighting flavours inspired by nature is a smart move: earth, water, fire, air and space. While reading the article states having a sensorial taste with each bite and honestly, with ingredients like Acacia Nectar, French Sea Salt, Candied Mango, and Ancho Chilli I don't doubt them. Promoting premium products is always a challenge, but leveraging advanced VR marketing would help this campaign gain more traction. I know for sure my team and I would love to get our hands on this!",

For about a year, I was teaching for 9\u201310 hours on Saturdays and Sundays as well. This eventually took a toll on my health, leading to a neck surgery (the scar you see on my neck is a reminder of that). The last online paid teaching session I conducted was a couple of years ago, for \u20b975,000 per hour. Since then, I have focused exclusively on being available through my platform takeUforward. Remember, no starting point is too small. With the right mindset and skills, you will eventually achieve success, it can be any profession.
